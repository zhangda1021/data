V1.0 of SAM (Principles: No negative value with least change and leave some space for future work)
Assumptions and adjustments in SAM:

Account A:
ca: from IO
fa: from IO (labor:labor payment; cap: depreciation+surplus)
ta: from IO (Production tax)
ac: from IO


Account C:
tc: set to be zero at this version
drc:from IO
rc: from IO

ch: ch from IO + negative inventory + error
g2d: gd from IO + negative inventory + error
der:from IO
er: from IO
cs: Fixed capital formation + positive inventory + error

Q1: How to deal with the error in the IO table?
A1:Compare Abs(error)/(ch+gd) and Abs(error)/cs, add error to the one which is smaller.
Record all the ratios which are bigger than 1.

Q2: How to deal with the trade deficit or surplus?
A2: Put this value in the household account. Reason 1: Household in SAM is related to production, capital and trade; Reason 2: In some cases, this value is too big (e.g. Zhejiang's export surplus is 3 times bigger than the government consumption), it will change less if we put this in the household


Account F:
hf(labor): from IO, fa(labor)
tf(labor):set to be zero at this version

hf(capital): from IO, fa(capital)-dp
g1f,g2f(capital):set to be zero at this version
tf(capital):set to be zero at this version
dp(capital): from IO


Account H:
drh/dhr, dhr/rh: calculated from IO, net domestic/international trade
th: set to be zero at this version
psv:residue
hg1:set to be zero at this version
hg2:residue


Account G (G1:central government, G2:provincial government. In this version, we assume the central government can only transfer revenue and saving):
g2g1:transfer from the central government to provincial government
gsv1:central government saving
g1g2:transfer from the provincial government to central government
gsv2:set to be zero at this version


Account T:
tr: calculated from IO, ta+tc+tf+th


Account DX: auto-balanced
Account X: auto-balanced
Account I: auto-balanced




China features:
1. SOE and state capital: taking a large proportion in the secondary industry, can not be modeled easily
2. Government income: land transfering fee... is the non-tax revenue out of the government budget... This is not a big issue in 2007, but in recent years, this revenue is crucial for the local government
