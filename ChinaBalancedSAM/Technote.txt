V1.0 of SAM (Principles: No negative value with least change)
Assumptions and adjustments in SAM:
Account A:
ca: from IO
fa: from IO (labor:labor payment; cap: depreciation+surplus)
ta: from IO (Production tax)
ac: from IO

Account C:
ch: ch from IO + negative inventory + error
gd: gd from IO + negative inventory + error
der:from IO
er: from IO
cs: Fixed capital formation + positive inventory + error

Q1: How to deal with the error in the IO table?
A1:Compare Abs(error)/(ch+gd) and Abs(error)/cs, add error to the one which is smaller.
Record all the ratios which are bigger than 1.

Account F:
hf(labor): from IO




Q2: How to deal with the trade deficit or surplus?
A2: Put this value in the household account. Reason 1: Household in SAM is related to production, capital and trade; Reason 2: In some cases, this value is too big (e.g. Zhejiang's export surplus is 3 times bigger than the government consumption), it will change less if we put this in the household






China features:
1. SOE and state capital: taking a large proportion in the secondary industry, can not be modeled easily
2. Government income: land transfering fee... is the non-tax revenue out of the government budget... This is not a big issue in 2007, but in recent years, this revenue is crucial for the local government
